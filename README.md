# Pulse
A Web Socket demonstration using Java EE 7 and Knockout JS.

The Java EE APIs are
* CDI Events
* Web Socket ServerEndpoint
* JSF
* EJBs

In this demonstration a Java EE 7 web server sends data to 3 of 9 random HTML panels every second. Knockout JS binds the data sent down the Web Socket to the boxes with very little JavaScript. The Java on the server is also very lightweight too.
